<h2>Gravity</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Try not to let realistic physics kill you. In space. Maybe with aliens. And asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Accomplishment, Frustration, learning, planning
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
survival action
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You've got an engine and some manuevering jets. And a computer, luckily - rotation doesn't stop on it's on in space, and spinning out sucks.

Press the up arrow for thrust, and the left - right arrows for rotation. Try not to run into anything.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

Some of the P2 physics engine - apparently this is less of a 'space' realism engine and more of a friction/springs thing.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Explosions
Space
Multiple planets with realistic gravity, rotation and orbits. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
you launched your shuttle!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
everyone?
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as you can stay alive. 1 - 2 min, I think.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
don't always hold the thrust/up arrow down. I might remap that to spacebar to get the point across better.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made nearly everything from scratch.

the music is from Musopen, the site with royalty free music. Bonus, it's the Air Force Band. 

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Asteroids?
