<h2>Beethoven's Mom</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A puzzle where you match the sheet music to the song
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Accomplishment 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle/point and click/card game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

flame button - plays the song you are trying to recreate
blue button - plays your current attempt at recreating it (doesn't currently work. pretty press animation, though)
Green check button - checks your work, plays awesome version of problem song if you got it right. Currently, you always get it right.
flame violin and piano - changes the playback instrument for the flame and blue buttons. Also the measures, though I haven't implemented that yet.

Measures - drag and drop into the order you think the song is. after clicking, you can use the WASD keys to flip and invert the measures - the measures 
are not necessarily in the correct orientation or order. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
multiple playback instruments
random orientation as well as order of puzzle pieces
Train your ear!
learn how to read rhythms in sheet music
Awesome classical music
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
none
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Dependent on player knowledge, song being used for the puzzle, possible difficulty levels.

this demo shouldn't take long.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
keep track of pitch going up or down
use the playback functions to check your work often

difficult choral things - listen to the part that moves, try and find the rhythm, not just the notes.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made nearly everything from scratch.
the background is from http://becuo.com/cool-music-background-hd.

the awesome version of twinkle twinkle little star is performed by Stefano Ligoratti, though I made the beginning and merged them in audacity
